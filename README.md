# DotNet Console Application Dependency Injection Example

This project contains a breif overview of Dependency injection using DotNet Console Application.

### What is Dependency Injection (DI)?
Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern in software development that deals with how components or services obtain their dependencies. In simpler terms, it's a technique where the dependencies of a class or module are injected from the outside, rather than being created or managed internally. This promotes loose coupling between components and makes the system more modular, maintainable, and testable.

### Different types of Dependency Injection.
1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided through the class's constructor. This is the most common type of DI.
2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are injected through setter methods. This allows for changing dependencies after the object has been instantiated.
3. Method Injection: Dependencies are provided through methods of the class when needed. This is often used for injecting dependencies only for specific operations.
